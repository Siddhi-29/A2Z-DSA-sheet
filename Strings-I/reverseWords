Problem: Reverse Words in a string

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Solution: 
*/
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces
        s = s.trim();
        
        // Split the string by one or more spaces
        String[] words = s.split("\\s+");
        
        // Reverse the array of words
        Collections.reverse(Arrays.asList(words));
        
        // Join the reversed array into a single string with spaces between words
        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
