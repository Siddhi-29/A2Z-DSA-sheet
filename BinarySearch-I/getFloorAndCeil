/*
Problem: Ceil The Floor

Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and an integer x, find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[].

Floor of x is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to x. Floor of x doesn’t exist if x is smaller than smallest element of arr[].
Ceil of x is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to x. Ceil of x doesn’t exist if x is greater than greatest element of arr[].

Return an array of integers denoting the [floor, ceil]. Return -1 for floor or ceiling if the floor or ceiling is not present.

Solution:
*/
class Solution {
    public int[] getFloorAndCeil(int x, int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int floor = -1, ceil = -1;
         
        for( int num : arr){
            if(num <= x && (floor == -1 || num > floor)){
                floor = num;
            }
            if(num >= x && (ceil == -1 || num < ceil)){
                ceil = num;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{floor, ceil};
    }
}
