Problem: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Solution:
*/
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length-1;

        while(start <= end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;

            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            
            // Check if the left half is sorted
            if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]){
                // Target is in the sorted left half
                if(nums[start] <= target && target < nums[mid]){
                    end = mid-1;
                }
                else{// Target is in the unsorted right half
                    start = mid+1;
                }
            }
            // Otherwise, the right half must be sorted
            else{
                // Target is in the sorted right half
                if(nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[end]){
                    start = mid+1;
                }
                else{// Target is in the unsorted left half
                    end = mid-1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
