/*II approach: If we iterate from the minimum of A and B down to 1, we reduce the number of iterations because we start from the potentially largest common factor.

Problem: 
LCM And GCD
Given two integers a and b, write a function lcmAndGcd() to compute their LCM and GCD. The function takes two integers a and b as input and returns a list containing their LCM and GCD.

Solution:

class Solution {
    static Long[] lcmAndGcd(Long A , Long B) {
        // code here
        long gcd = 1;
        Long[] res = new Long[2];
        for (long i = Math.min(A, B); i > 1; i--) {
